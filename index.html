      <p>
        Hey! I'm Noah, a software engineer based on the South Coast of the United Kingdom. Outside of work, you can find me playing bass, running or playing video games.
      </p>

      <p>
        I prefer working with backend/infrastructure, but can also build passable front-ends when needed. I could bore you with a long list, but I won't, so here's my top three things:
        <ul>
          <li>Golang</li>
          <li>Kubernetes</li>
          <li>Typescript/Javascript NodeJS</li>
        </ul>

      </p>

      <p>
        Find me online:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/strideynet">Github</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://keybase.io/strideynet">Keybase</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nstride/">Flickr</a></li>
        </ul>
        Or ping me an email: hi@noahstride.co.uk
      </p>

      <p>I might be able to help you with your project, if you think that's the case, get in touch. I'm available for projects if I deem them interesting.</p>
      <h3>So long, and thanks for all the fish :)</h3>
