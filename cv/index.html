      <h3>Employments</h3>
      <h4>WalkIn | Senior Backend Engineer | June 2020 - Ongoing</h4>
      <p>More info, coming soon...</p>

      <h4>Cudo Ventures | Software Engineer | Aug 2018 - May 2020</h4>
      <p>
        I joined Cudo Ventures as a fullstack engineer straight out of college, working on the NodeJS API, Electron App and Vue web app,
        but as the team grew my role to focus solely on backend development and infrastructure,
        eventually providing support and mentoring as Cudo used Golang in production for the first time.
      </p>

      <p>
        At Cudo, I held multiple responsibilites from managing the Kubernetes clusters,
        infrastructure tools (e.g Prometheus/Grafana) and deployment mechanisms, as well as working directly
        with customers where they had more unusual deployments of our product into datacenter environments. As one
        of the engineers with a more indepth understanding of Linux, networking and datacenter environments, I was able
        to provide insight and knowledge to other members of the team.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some of the technologies I worked with at Cudo:
        <ul>
          <li>Frontend: Vue, Vuex, React, Redux, Electron</li>
          <li>Backend: Javascript (Loopback), Typescript, Golang</li>
          <li>Ops: GCP, Kubernetes, Ansible (Kubespray)</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h4>Freelancing & Consulting | Nov 2016 - Ongoing</h4>
      <p>
        Since late 2016 I've completed freelance projects for a variety of clients with a focus on quality delivery of a solution
        that meets the client's needs. Projects are generally fullstack web applications, but I have also provided consulting to other
        developers on scaling their projects and deploying them onto cloud platforms.
